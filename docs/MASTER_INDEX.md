## 🎯 The Challenge

**Current Situation:**
- MACDEnhanced strategy underperforming: 12.8% alpha vs. 21.5% for MACDCrossover
- Gap: -8.7% alpha (-40.6% relative underperformance)
- Root cause: Unknown
- Path to improvement: Unclear

**What Was Determined:**
- Root cause identified: Entry gate thresholds (rs_threshold=0.30, bias_threshold=0.20) filter 30-50% of valid MACD crosses
- Recovery potential: 80-90% of gap recoverable (target: <5% gap)
- Optimization path: 3-phase program (Phase 1: +5-8%, Phase 2: +1-2%, Phase 3: +0.3-1%)
- Time to first results: 2-4 hours (Phase 1 automation ready)

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Review Current Status
```bash
# Verify configuration was updated
cat config.json | grep -A2 "default_strategies"
# Expected:
#   "entry": "MACDCrossoverStrategy",
#   "exit": "MVX_N9_R3p5_T1p6_D18_B20p0"
```

**Result:** ✅ MACDCrossoverStrategy (21.5% alpha) now default

### 2. Understand the Investigation
```
Read:  VISUAL_SUMMARY.md (10 min)
Then:  STRATEGY_OPTIMIZATION_STATUS.md (10 min)
Deep:  MACD_ENHANCED_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md (30 min if detailed)
```

**Result:** Understand root cause (entry gates too strict) and recovery path

### 3. Execute Phase 1 Optimization
```bash
# When ready, run Phase 1 grid search:
python tools/grid_search_macd_enhanced.py \
  --years 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 \
  --output macd_enhanced_phase1_results

# Monitor output:
# - Progress: "Testing rs_threshold=0.20, bias_threshold=0.10..."
# - Results: CSV with 20 combinations ranked by alpha
# - Summary: Top 3 combinations with expected alpha values
```

**Result:** ~100 backtests (2-4 hours), identify winning parameters

### 4. Make Phase 1 Decision
```
IF Phase 1 results ≥18% alpha:
  → Phase 1 SUCCESS (±1.5% alpha gap from MACDCrossover)
  → Proceed to Phase 2 (recovery window tuning)
  → Target: ≥20% alpha (±0.5% gap)
  
IF Phase 1 results <18% alpha:
  → Phase 1 INCONCLUSIVE
  → Finalize MACDCrossover as production default
  → Document findings for future reference
```

## 🔍 What You Need to Know

### The Problem (One Sentence)
MACDEnhanced's entry gates filter too strictly (rs_threshold>0.30, bias_threshold>0.20), eliminating 30-50% of valid MACD crosses and losing -8.7% alpha.

### The Solution (One Sentence)
Relax entry gate thresholds to rs_threshold=0.20, bias_threshold=0.10 to admit more valid entry opportunities, expected to recover +5-8% alpha in Phase 1.

### The Roadmap (Three Phases)
1. **Phase 1:** Test entry gate thresholds (20 combinations, 2-4 hrs) → Target +5-8% alpha
2. **Phase 2:** Tune oversold detection window (if Phase 1 ≥18%) → Target +1-2% alpha
3. **Phase 3:** Rebalance contribution weights (if Phase 2 needed) → Target +0.3-1% alpha

### The Decision Criteria
- **Success threshold:** ≥18% alpha after Phase 1 (gap ≤3.5%)
- **Target:** ≥20% alpha after all phases (gap ≤1.5%)
- **Fallback:** Keep MACDCrossover default if Phase 1 <18% alpha

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

### Phase 1 Success Scenario
```
Current:  rs_th=0.30, bias_th=0.20 → 12.8% alpha
Phase 1:  rs_th=0.20, bias_th=0.10 → 18.5% alpha (+5.7%)
Phase 2:  Adjust lookback, recovery range → 19.8% alpha (+3.0% Phase 1+2)
Phase 3:  Rebalance weights → 20.5% alpha (+3.7% total)

Result: -8.7% gap → -1.0% gap (88.5% recovery achieved)
```

### Conservative Scenario
```
Current:  rs_th=0.30, bias_th=0.20 → 12.8% alpha
Phase 1:  Some improvement, but <18% → ???

Decision: Keep MACDCrossover (21.5% alpha) as default
Document: Why MACDEnhanced remains suboptimal for this market
